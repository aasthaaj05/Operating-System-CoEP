# Operating Systems – CoEP (Odd Semester 2025–26)

This repository contains the **lab tasks and assignments** completed as part of the *Operating Systems* course at **College of Engineering Pune (CoEP)**, taught by **Prof. Abhijit A. M.** during the Odd Semester 2025–26.

Each file begins with the **problem statement** (as a comment) followed by my implementation. The work spans a wide range of concepts—from basic **Linux system calls**, file operations, and shell programming, to more advanced topics such as **adding new system calls to the Linux kernel**, exploring **xv6 internals**, **file systems** in linux, **slab allocator** in xv6  and implementing a **1:1 threading library**.
